# Coding Challenge - Getting Started

Welcome to Determined AI!

Here we have a small webapp and we're looking to expand the functionality of it.

## Preparation

Please make sure you have the following dependencies installed and ready to go.

- `node`:  v14 recommended
- `npm`: > v6. This usually comes bundled with `node`
- `git`
- your favorite code/text editor
- `zoom`
- a mic and a webcam

Clone this repository and run the following to get started:

```
npm install && npm start
```

You should be able to point your browser to `http://localhost:3000` if webpack-dev-server doesn't already do this for you.  If everything is in working order, you should see a `Hello from Determined AI` message!
